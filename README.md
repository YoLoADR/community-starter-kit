## üëã Hey! Want to jump from web2 to web3?
[Join our Discord](https://discord.gg/Zqs3bwV5). Web3 can give rise to new opportunities for millions.

Here's what you'll get:

‚úÖ a group of internet friends to build with.

‚úÖ the ability to earn NFTs as you build stuff.

‚úÖ access to experts who can answer any question you have.

## üìö Projects

At [youarelucky](http://youarelucky.io/) we take a lot of time to write projects that make sense and are just straight up fun! Just like software, we are bound to make some mistakes, but thats where you come in.

We made all these lessons Open Source so you can help make our projects even better and help others conquer the decentralized web ü§ò.

## üõ† Contributing

Any and all contributions are welcome! GitHub makes it _insanely_ easy to make contributions directly within their web app! [Follow this short guide](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/working-with-files/managing-files/editing-files#editing-files-in-another-users-repository) on how to edit one of our Markdown lessons right here within GitHub!

Rather watch a video? [Check out this two minute video](#), by Yohann from YouAreLucky, for submitting a contribution to a lesson!

### Structure
You will notice in each project folder there is an `en` and `fr` folder. We are in the process of translating our projects to Spanish (and hopefully more languages)!

If you are contributing to the English version, make sure your changes are done in the `en/` folder. If you are contributing to the French or Spanish version, make sure to make your changes in the `fr/` or`es/` folder!

Each project aligns with the content on your YouAreLucky dashboard. Find the file you want to change and open up a Pull Request for it! Someone from the YouAreLucky team will take a look at it ASAP!
